# Nextion screens for uBitx KD8CEC firmware
 This repository contains improved Nextion screens that support the original KD8CEC firmware for the uBitx.

KD8CEC (Ian Lee, hamskey.com) developed an enhanced set of firmware for the uBitx transceiver designed by Ashhar Farham (VU2ESE) and sold by his company HF Signals Electronics Pvt. ltd (https://www.hfsignals.com/). KD8CEC created the first touchscreen UX for the uBitx using the Nextion smart screens to offload the processing and memory requirements over the already overloaded Arduino nano used by the uBitx.

Ian created a wide variety of screens, especially for the smaller Nextion screens. Larger screens were not supported and generally resulted in only a portion of the screen being used. 

This work reflects an extension of his work into areas:
1. Additional screen sizes are natively supported (e.g. 3.5, 5, 7, etc.)
2. "Enhancements" to the UX that IMHO made it easier to use and fixed some inconsistency.

This work is open source and I have included the original Nextion GUI tool input files.  They worked on the Nextion tool that was provided at the time 2019/2020. They likely need to be migrated to the latest tool and I will do so  when time permits.
