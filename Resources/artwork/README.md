#ARTWORK

Since all artwork has to be resized externally from the Nextion editor, the availability of the "pngs" for various size screens is important. The good thing is that if you see some artwork you like, you can fireup the Nextion editor, select the picture tab on bottom right, slecet the picture you like, and then just hit right click.

It would be *nice* if someone would make available all the artwork in a lossless re-scalable format. But until then, the Export process is the only option.
