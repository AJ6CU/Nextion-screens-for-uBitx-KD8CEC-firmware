# KD8CEC 9.0" Screens

The Nextion editors will no longer generate .ttf files for the 9" screen. These files are included for historical reasons. If you have a 9" screen, the .tft might prove to work (or not...)

If you need to reach me, you can look my email address up on QRZ. I also frequently monitor the BTIX20 group on groups.io
