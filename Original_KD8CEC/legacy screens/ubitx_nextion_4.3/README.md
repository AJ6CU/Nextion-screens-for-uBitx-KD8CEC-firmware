# KD8CEC 4.3" Screens

The 4.3" screens provided by KD8CEC *do not* fill the full screen.

If you have a 4.3" screen, you would be better off to look at one of the user contributed designs for 4.3" screens.

If you need to reach me, you can look my email address up on QRZ. I also frequently monitor the BTIX20 group on groups.io
